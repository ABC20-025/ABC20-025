              Milan, Italian Milano, city, capital of Milano province (provincia)
              and of the region (regione) of Lombardy (Lombardia), northern Italy.
              It is the leading financial centre and the most prosperous manufacturing and
              commercial city of Italy. <br> Area city, 70 square miles (182 square km); province, 765 square miles (1,980 square km).
              Pop. (2001) city, 1,256,211; province, 3,707,210; (2007 est.) city, 1,303,437; province, 3,884,481.
          </p> <br>
            <p>The fact that Milan is at a distance from much of the rest of Italy, that it is peripheral in a geographic sense, does not
              explain its position of “second city,” a position it has always vainly fought. Indeed, some of the greatest European capitals
              are peripheral in this sense. Rather, Milan’s role was the consequence of the immense historical importance and the enormous
              accumulation of myths and symbols that conferred on Milan’s antagonist, Rome, an inevitable prestige.</p>

         <h2>the moral capital</h2>

         <div class="mid"><a href=#><img src="images\hist.jpg" ></a>
         </div>

         <p>Milan has long been known as its “moral capital.” When the Milanese assert that their city is the moral capital, they not only express
           the ancient regionalism typical of all Italy and known as campanilismo (a reference to the church bell of each city), but they also refer
           to the city’s quality and values, historical as well as contemporary. <br><br> The claim is justified by contributions in every field—economic,
           cultural, and ideological—that the city of Milan, in modern times, and particularly since the unification of Italy, has made to the Italian state.
           It was partly out of an opposition to the nature of Rome as a capital of government, and thereby the perceived capital of taxation, state spending,
           and political skullduggery, that Milan’s self-image as Italy’s moral capital was born.

         <p> in the late 19th century as an industrializing Milan set itself up as a capital of innovation, production, and efficiency—values the Milanese
           considered absent in Rome. The city’s sense of moral superiority—particularly the idea that the Milanese people were morally superior because of their positive
         work ethic—was reinforced as Milan ultimately became Italy’s centre of industry and finance, as well as the motor behind the country’s extraordinary economic development in the 20th century.
          Today Milan is the richest city in Italy and one of the richest in Europe.
