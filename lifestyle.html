                The Italian city of Milan is known to be one of the world's most important fashion capitals,
                along with Paris, New York and London. It has become the dream city for many fashion fanatics and aspiring fashion designers.
                Most of the major Italian fashion houses and labels are based in Milan such as Armani, Bottega Veneta,
                 Dolce & Gabbana and Missoni to name a few. <br>
                The high fashion standards have led to Milan hosting its own Fashion week twice a year that the entire fashion world looks forward to.

                  The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is a spot you really can't miss. It's the world's oldest active shopping mall. Housed within a four-story
                   double arcade in central Milan, the Galleria is named after Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of the Kingdom of Italy...and the architecture is simply stunning.
                   The second most vibrant spot for shopping in Milan is Corso Buenos Aires. It is said to be one of the longest shopping street in Europe.

      Consider that St. Augustine was baptized in a basilica that stood at what is now Piazza del Duomo;
       artists Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, the composer Verdi, the great tenor Enrico Caruso, and
       designer Giorgio Armani all lived and worked here. Below are some places you may consider to visit:</p>

            <h3> 1. II Duomo (Milan Cathedral)</h3>
         <br>
           <!--image-->

           </div>

           <p>
             The massive Cathedral of Santa Maria Nascente, which the Milanese call just "Il Duomo" is among the
             world's largest (it holds up to 40,000 people) and most magnificent churches, the ultimate example of
              the Flamboyant Gothic style. It was begun in the 14th century, but its façade was not completed until
              the early 1800s, under Napoleon.
           </p>
<br>
            <p>
              The roof is topped by 135 delicately carved stone pinnacles and the exterior is decorated with 2,245 marble
               statues. The dim interior, in striking contrast to the brilliant and richly patterned exterior, makes a powerful
               impression with its 52 gigantic pillars. The stained-glass windows in the nave (mostly 15th-16th centuries) are the
                largest in the world; the earliest of them are in the south aisle.

            <h3>2. Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper</h3> <br>
                <!--image-->

                <p>
                  The Gothic brick church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, in the Corso Magenta, was begun about 1465, and its massive six-sided
                  dome in the finest Early Renaissance style was designed by Bramante, one of Italy's most influential Renaissance architects.

                  The church - and adjoining refectory, which holds Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper - were badly damaged in World War II
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>the reason most tourists visit Santa Maria delle Grazie is to see da Vinci's most famous work, painted on the refectory wall
                   of the former Dominican monastery. The Cenacolo Vinciano, as it is called here, was painted on the wall in tempera between 1495 and 1497.</p>

                  Marking the beginning of modern architecture in Italy, today it stands as a splendid example of 19th-century industrial iron and glass construction. And it's still a
                   beautiful, vibrant place where locals meet for lunch or coffee in its elegant cafés. and browse in its luxury shops. It is so much a part of local life that
                   the inhabitants of Milan refer to it as "il salotto" (the salon). <br> There are luxurious shops with trending fashion from handbags and clothes of the latest season.
